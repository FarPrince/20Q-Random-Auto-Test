# 20Q-Random-Auto-Test

I didn't like Quizlet paywalling the test feature. This program allows you to export Quizlet sets (":" between terms, "\n" between cards), and test yourself. The "definitions" will be given, and the program will ask for the corresponding "term"

I have AP Lang terms in the terms.txt file
